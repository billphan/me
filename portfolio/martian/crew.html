                    <br>
                    Originally trained as a fighter pilot, Major Martinez eventually worked his way to the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base where he made his mark as a top-notch pilot and continued to earn the respect and admiration of peers and commanders throughout his career.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By age fifteen, the Major knew that his ultimate goal was NASA. His first step towards making that dream come true was earning a bachelor of science in astronautical engineering at the United States
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As he gets ready to embark on the mission of a lifetime, Martinez has the full support of his family and wishes that everyone will one day have the chance to visit space.</p>

                    <br>
                    For his doctorate, Vogel spent six months in Antarctica performing research in conjunction with the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany. The study examined ancient ice samples and measured chemical traces of greenhouse gases in ice cores.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While in the field, he passed the time by volunteering to help with efforts to measure cosmic microwave background and has published dozens of papers in international journals.

                    <h1>BETH JOHANSSEN</h1>

                    <p>Beth Johanssen displayed a prodigious aptitude for technology at an early age. Graduating high school at just sixteen, she&#39;d go on to win NASA&#39;s largest hackathon when she was seventeen before moving on to MIT for dual undergraduate degrees in math and computer science.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Johanssen started a private software company prior to starting graduate school at Stanford University. Drawn to Silicon Valley, she was intent on becoming a software engineer and CEO. However, during this time she would come into contact with SpaceX executive Brett Parker at a conference on advanced systems theory. Impressed by her work, Parker recruited Johanssen to help develop the software that would later become an integral part of the Hermes operating system. Her work on the project inspired her decision to switch paths and join NASA.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fueled by her desire to make the trek to Mars, she was able to leverage her experience with the Hermes and secure a spot on the Ares III as its System Operator and Reactor Technician. Her knowledge and skill set make her an invaluable addition to the mission.</p>
